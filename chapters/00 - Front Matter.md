# Grunt Up & Running

A book by Dan Burzo ([@danburzo](http://twitter.com/danburzo))

## About this book

This is a book about using Grunt to automate your web development workflow. It covers Grunt v0.4.x.

It's based on the [Grunt Documentation](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [API Reference](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt) and takes cues from Bel√©n Albeza's excellent primer [_Power-up Your Front-End Development with Grunt_](https://leanpub.com/grunt), which I encourage you to take a look at.

You can find the book on GitHub: https://github.com/danburzo/grunt-recipes. Contributions & corrections are always welcome.
