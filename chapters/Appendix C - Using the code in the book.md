Each chapter in this book comes with code samples that you can run to get a better idea of how the concepts apply in real life. You can download the code here: [[LINK]]

To install the necessary dependencies for each project, open up a console and navigate to the project folder. Then simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

NPM (Node Package Manager) will install Grunt and the other plugins needed to run the Gruntfile.

You can also check out the `README.md` file that comes with each project for more details.
