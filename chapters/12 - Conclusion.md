Here you are, you've made it to the end of the book. I hope it was a worthwhile read. Armed with this knowledge, you should be able to use any Grunt plugin you come accross and even write your own.

### What now

If you're still looking for a challenge, here are a few suggestions:

* Look into [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), which builds upon Grunt to help you scaffold new applications by generating the necessary project structure, fetching third-party libraries and adding all the Grunt tasks you need to get started;
* Fix a bug in your favorite Grunt plugin;
* Help make this book better! You can [contribute on GitHub](http://github.com/danburzo/grunt-recipes).
