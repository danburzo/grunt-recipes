# Grunt Up & Running

A book by Dan Burzo ([@danburzo](http://twitter.com/danburzo))

## About this book

This is a book about using Grunt to automate your web development workflow. You should have some basic experience in JavaScript, the language that drives Grunt, but don't get too hung up on that part. 

You can find the book on GitHub: https://github.com/danburzo/grunt-recipes. Contributions/corrections are always welcome. Always.
